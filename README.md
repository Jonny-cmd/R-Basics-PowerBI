# R-Basics-PowerBI
Basic commands used in R to clean data, and transfer into a dashboard in Power BI.

The step by step process in cleaning the data using R is in the Word Project Document.

Creating a Dashboard with the following requirements:

•	The company would like me to use their brand colors which are blue, green and brown.
•	See the average Rotten Tomatoes rating for each genre
•	Number of movies produced each year
•	Audience score for each film
•	Profitability per studio
•	Worldwide gross per genre


Average ratings and count of films per year are very clear in a simple bar chart. However, Audience score by film does not suit a bar chart as there are way too many individual films to try and squash onto one. A Treemap suited it much better as I can easily see each individual film name and its score. 

I made the score for each individual film small enough to fit on the dashboard, if you want the full film name you will have to hover over each one unfortunately, as it is difficult to represent each full name on a single screen. Ideally I would split it up into two dashboards to give more room and options, but I wanted it all to be presentable on one screen.


My Final Dashboard turned out like this:
